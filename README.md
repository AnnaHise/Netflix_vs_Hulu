**Netflix vs Hulu: Which Streaming Service is Better?**

Objective: Use data to tell a story and answer a question/problem

Overview: I compared the two streaming services to see the proportion of each type of content offered on both platforms, the proportion of ratings in each of those types of content, as well as the top genres. From there, I combined the datasets to see how many titles were overlapping between the two streaming services.

"Better" is a subjective term; however, the data shows that one platform may be better suited for an individual based on their viewing preferences.

**Cleaning the Datasets:**
- addressing null values
- dropping columns
- fixing columns with incorrect information (e.g. durations in rating column)
- changing columns to lower string so they can be easily compared
